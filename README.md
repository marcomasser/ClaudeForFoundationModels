# Claude for Foundation Models

Use Claude as a server-side language model through Apple's [Foundation Models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels) framework. The package conforms Claude to the framework's `LanguageModel` protocol, so you drive it with the same `LanguageModelSession` API you use for Apple's on-device model — `respond(to:)`, streaming, guided generation, and tool calling all work the same way.

> **Beta.** This package targets the Foundation Models server-side language model API introduced in the OS 27 betas. APIs may change before general availability.

## Requirements

- iOS 27, macOS 27, visionOS 27, or watchOS 27 (beta) — the OS releases whose Foundation Models framework supports server-side language models.
- Xcode 27 (beta).
- A credential: an App Attest client ID from the Anthropic console, or an API key for simulator development. See [Authentication](#authentication).

## Installation

Add the package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/anthropics/ClaudeForFoundationModels.git", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

Or in Xcode: **File ▸ Add Package Dependencies…** and enter the repository URL.

Then add `ClaudeForFoundationModels` to your target's dependencies and import it alongside `FoundationModels`:

```swift
import FoundationModels
import ClaudeForFoundationModels
```

## Quick start

```swift
import FoundationModels
import ClaudeForFoundationModels

let model = ClaudeLanguageModel(
  name: .sonnet5,
  auth: .apiKey(ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] ?? "")
)

let session = LanguageModelSession(model: model)
let response = try await session.respond(to: "Plan a 4-day trip to Buenos Aires.")
print(response.content)
```

`ClaudeLanguageModel` is the entry point. Pass it to `LanguageModelSession` and use the session exactly as you would with any Foundation Models provider.

## Example

[`Examples/ClaudeExample`](Examples/ClaudeExample) is a runnable command-line target that streams one chat turn through `LanguageModelSession` to the terminal, with token usage at the end (running it requires a macOS 27 host):

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key> swift run ClaudeExample "What should I see in Kyoto?"
```

Pass `--search` to enable server-side web search for the turn:

```sh
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key> swift run ClaudeExample --search "Top spaceflight news this week?"
```

## Choosing a model

Model identifiers are values of `ClaudeModel`. Use a compiled-in constant, or construct one with explicit capabilities for an ID that isn't compiled in yet (see [Capabilities](#capabilities)):

```swift
ClaudeLanguageModel(name: .opus4_8, auth: auth)
```

Constants mirror API model IDs (`.opus4_8` is `claude-opus-4-8`) and carry each model's capabilities. New models ship as new constants in package releases.

Dateless model IDs like `claude-opus-4-8` (the 4.6 generation onward) are pinned snapshots, not evergreen pointers — the model behind an ID doesn't change underneath you.

### Capabilities

Each model declares what it accepts — sampling parameters, effort levels, adaptive thinking, structured output, and image input. The bridge uses this to decide which request fields to send, since sending a field a model rejects is a hard error. The constants carry the right capabilities. For an ID that isn't compiled in, declare what the model accepts:

```swift
let model = ClaudeModel(
  id: "claude-experimental-x",
  capabilities: .init(effortLevels: [.low, .high], structuredOutput: true)
)
ClaudeLanguageModel(name: model, auth: auth)
```

### Effort

Pin a Claude effort level for every request with `fixedEffort:`. It takes precedence over the framework's per-request reasoning hints. The API defaults to `high` when no effort is sent:

```swift
ClaudeLanguageModel(name: .opus4_8, auth: auth, fixedEffort: .xhigh)
```

The framework's reasoning levels map to effort per request: `.light` → `low`, `.moderate` → `medium`, `.deep` → `high`, and `.custom` accepts a Claude effort name directly (`"xhigh"`, `"max"`). Levels a model doesn't accept are dropped — a reasoning level is a hint, not a contract.

The level must be one the model accepts — each model declares which of the five levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`) it takes.

## Authentication

Set the credential with the `auth:` parameter.

```swift
// Recommended. Register the app in the Anthropic console to get a client ID;
// each install then proves it's a genuine, unmodified copy via App Attest,
// and usage bills to your workspace. The app ships no key and needs no
// developer backend. Works in development and production; requires a
// physical device.
ClaudeLanguageModel(name: .sonnet5, auth: .appAttest(clientID: "clid_..."))

// An API key is useful for simulator iteration. A bundled key is
// extractable from a shipping app, so don't release with one.
ClaudeLanguageModel(name: .sonnet5, auth: .apiKey("..."))

// Your own backend. The relay at `baseURL` adds the credential server-side;
// the app ships no key. `headers` are sent on every request so the proxy
// can authorize the caller — pass `[:]` if it needs none.
ClaudeLanguageModel(
  name: .sonnet5,
  auth: .proxied(headers: ["X-App-Token": "..."]),
  baseURL: URL(string: "https://api.yourapp.com/claude")!
)
```

### App Attest

`.appAttest` needs three things:

- **A registered app.** Register the app's team ID and bundle ID in the
  Anthropic console. The client ID it issues is public configuration that is
  safe to include in the app binary. App registration is currently rolling
  out and can be found
  [here](https://platform.claude.com/settings/workspaces/default/app-integrations)
  once available.
- **The App Attest capability.** Add the App Attest entitlement to the app
  (`com.apple.developer.devicecheck.appattest-environment`); this requires an
  explicitly registered App ID.
- **A physical device.** Simulators and hardware without a Secure Enclave
  throw `ClaudeError.attestationUnsupported` — keep `.apiKey` for simulator
  iteration.

The first request on a fresh install attests the device with Apple (a few
seconds, once per install). Front that cost at app launch instead of paying
it on the first prompt:

```swift
try await model.authenticateIfNeeded()
```

This throws if attestation fails — an unregistered client ID, an unsupported
device — so the app learns before the user's first prompt does.
`session.prewarm()` also starts attestation, but as a fire-and-forget hint
with no error reporting; prefer `authenticateIfNeeded()` when the app should
react to failure. After first run, requests reuse a cached short-lived token
from the Keychain, and renewing an expired token costs only a local Secure
Enclave signature and one short round trip (two after an app relaunch);
renewal never repeats the attestation.
Credentials are device-bound and never sync or back up.

## Streaming

`streamResponse(to:)` returns the response incrementally. Each element is a cumulative snapshot:

```swift
let stream = session.streamResponse(to: "Summarize today's top science stories.")
for try await partial in stream {
  print(partial.content)
}
```

## Structured output

Annotate a type with `@Generable` and request it with `generating:`. The model returns a value of that type:

```swift
@Generable
struct Trip {
  @Guide(description: "Destination city") var destination: String
  @Guide(description: "Length in days") var days: Int
}

let response = try await session.respond(to: "Plan a trip to Tokyo.", generating: Trip.self)
print(response.content.destination)
```

Structured output requires a model whose capabilities include it (all compiled-in constants do).

## Server-side tools

Server-side tools run on Anthropic's infrastructure within a single round-trip — web search, web fetch, and code execution. Configure them per model with `serverTools:`:

```swift
let model = ClaudeLanguageModel(
  name: .sonnet5,
  auth: auth,
  serverTools: [
    .webSearch(maxUses: 5),
    .codeExecution,
  ]
)
```

`.webSearch` and `.webFetch` accept a `domains:` filter — `.unrestricted` (the default), `.allowing([...])`, or `.blocking([...])` — and an optional `maxUses`. These are distinct from the framework's `tools:` array, which holds client-side tools the framework invokes on the device.

## Error handling

Provider errors that don't map onto a Foundation Models `LanguageModelError` surface as `ClaudeError`. Pattern-match to drive product flows:

```swift
do {
  let response = try await session.respond(to: prompt)
  print(response.content)
} catch ClaudeError.missingCredential {
  // Prompt for an API key.
} catch {
  // Foundation Models errors (guardrails, context length, decoding) and transport errors.
}
```

## What this package provides

The public surface is Apple's Foundation Models provider conformance plus the configuration types that reach it — `ClaudeLanguageModel`, `ClaudeModel`, `AuthMode`, and `ClaudeServerTool`. It is not a general-purpose Anthropic Messages API client.
